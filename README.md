# Note Taker
    
## Description 
    
Note Taker is an Express.JS app deployed on Heroku that helps in quickly building a list of notes. 

The app is compliant to OOP using classes to build notes entities/objects. 
The _save_ icon creates an `app.post` call on the server side to store the specified note in an array of objects.
The stored notes are then rendered in a list on client side.
When any note in the list is accessed, an `app.get` call is made and the note is rendered on the client side.
The _delete_ icon creates an `app.delete` call in order for the note to be taken out from the database. The client side list is then rerendered.
